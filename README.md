## FAQ

**Q:** Why do you use the same scraper package as other addons?

**A:** Scrapers are a project on their own. I do not wish to develop scrapers. I have partnered with another developer to use scrapers provided by an outside source.


**Q:** Why should I use this instead of Venom?

**A:** Venom has been retired. Respect the developer and let it go. 123Venom was an amazing developer, I chose this addon to clone because I used it and it worked well. If you don't want to use this plugin, don't. Please don't waste my time or yours with comparisons to Venom, I won't waste my time justifying why you should use an addon I maintain for free.


**Q:** Do you take feature requests?

**A:** Of course, open an issue.
