Then Select Done. For "Enter a name for this media source" input "Umbrella" or whatever you would like to name the source.

## Issues
Issues are closed currently. Ask for help on Reddit.

## Logs
If you are reporting an issue, logs are going to be requested. Save yourself and me some time.
Enable Logs: Go to Umbrella settings and select Debugging on the left hand side.
Set your settings like this:

Set your debug settings, reproduce the issue, then go to Tools > Logging Tools > Umbrella - Upload log file to pastebin
Attach the URL to the issue you open.
If your logs are requested and you do not post them your issue will be closed without being looked at. I'm unable to resolve issues without knowing the problem and I **need** the logs to identify the issue.

## Test Versions
Testing is done using a second repo. Test versions are unstable and move quickly. If you would like to test, let me know. Please do not download test versions of the plugin without knowing what is included. Some test builds could include extensive logging that is hard on your system. I would not advise anyone to download a test version without talking to me first.

## FAQ

**Q:** Why do you use the same scraper package as other addons?

**A:** Scrapers are a project on their own. I do not wish to develop scrapers. I have partnered with another developer to use scrapers provided by an outside source.


**Q:** Why should I use this instead of Venom?

**A:** Venom has been retired. Respect the developer and let it go. 123Venom was an amazing developer, I chose this addon to clone because I used it and it worked well. If you don't want to use this plugin, don't. Please don't waste my time or yours with comparisons to Venom, I won't waste my time justifying why you should use an addon I maintain for free.


**Q:** Do you take feature requests?

**A:** Of course, open an issue. Use the feature request template.


**Q:** How do I contact you?

**A:** If you are reading this on GitHub you have found the best way to contact me already. Please open issues or feature requests here. Chat requests, direct messages, discord, reddit posts are not a great way to contact me and I do not always see these things. I will always see a GitHub issue.
