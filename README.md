# Umbrella - A Video Plugin for Kodi

Welcome to the umbrellaplug.github.io wiki!

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues. 
Currently for Kodi 19 and working for Nexus Alphas (with lots of warnings).

~~Clone~~ Fork of Venom

## Installation Instructions:
From Kodi:
System > File Manager > Select Add Source

For "Enter the paths or browse for the media locations" select "None" and input:

**https://umbrellaplug.github.io**

Then Select Done. For "Enter a name for this media source" input "Umbrella" or whatever you would like to name the source.
Click Ok.

From the Kodi Homescreen select "Add-ons".
At the top on the left hand side select the box icon under "Add-ons" (Add-on Browser).

Install the Umbrella repository by clicking on Install from Zip File then "Umbrella" then repository.umbrella-x-x-x.zip and waiting for the repository installed icon to appear in the top right corner.

Select "Install From Repository" then Umbrella Repo then Video Add-ons then Umbrella. Click on Install and wait for the Add-on Enabled Notification.

## Setup Instructions

From the main menu, navigate to Tools > Settings > Trakt
Follow the onscreen instructions and authorize Trakt.

Next add any debrid services you use and follow the on-screen instructions.

**The plugin will not work without at least 1 debrid account**

## Issues
**issues are closed, I'm tired of the nonsense.**

## Logs
If you are reporting an issue, logs are going to be requested. Save yourself and me some time.
Enable Logs: Go to Umbrella settings and select Debugging on the left hand side.
Set your settings like this:

Set your debug settings, reproduce the issue, then go to Tools > Logging Tools > Umbrella - Upload log file to pastebin
Attach the URL to the issue you open.
If your logs are requested and you do not post them your issue will be closed without being looked at. I'm unable to resolve issues without knowing the problem and I **need** the logs to identify the issue.

## Test Versions
Testing is done using a second repo. Test versions are unstable and move quickly. If you would like to test, let me know. Please do not download test versions of the plugin without knowing what is included. Some test builds could include extensive logging that is hard on your system. I would not advise anyone to download a test version without talking to me first.

## FAQ

**Q:** Why do you use the same scraper package as other addons?

**A:** Scrapers are a project on their own. I do not wish to develop scrapers. I have partnered with another developer to use scrapers provided by an outside source.
